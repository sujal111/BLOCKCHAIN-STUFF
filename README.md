# NoCopy

Say no to plagiarism once and for all.

Content creators upload their work on platforms like Youtube, Pinterest, Imgur, Spotify or personal blogs to showcase their work and earn money at times. This content often gets copied directly by people without attributing the creator which leads to the problem of plagiarism and before someone actually reports the copyright issue, the plagiarist might have already earned or got wrongful credits of some work which he does not own. "NoCopy" is a content-sharing platform where content creators can share documents, audio files and images without the worry of it being stolen by someone and being used wrongfully. By using the immutability of the blockchain, every original file gets its fingerprint stored in the form of blocks on a public blockchain network where it resides forever. Every new upload's hash value gets compared with all the hashes and if a match is found, the new upload is termed as a copied work and discarded. This system ensures that whenever a plagiarist tries to impersonate someone else, he gets caught and is not allowed to share someone else's work or creation. By using such a robust system, content creators can worry less on legal suits and copyright issues, and focus more on solving problems by creating content that matters. This way, people can rightly claim a digital property and no false ownership claims may arise. With blockchain, we can build a world where people can trust in the system and work more efficiently, and "NoCopy" is just an example of it.
